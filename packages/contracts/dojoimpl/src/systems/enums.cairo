/// * `WaitingForOpponent`: The stage after the creator has committed their solution hash (or

///                         and the game is waiting for an opponent to join and/or commit their

/// expected to commit the hash of their secret solution.
/// * `Playing`: The main gameplay stage where both players have committed their solution hashes,
/// and they are actively submitting guesses
///              and providing hit/blow feedback.
/// * `Reveal`: The final stage of the game, typically reached after a win or a tie. In this stage,
/// players can reveal their
///             actual solutions to be verified against their committed hashes.
